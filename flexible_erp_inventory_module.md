## ✅ Design Philosophy

- 💡 **Everything modular:** All features are included but **disabled by default**.
- 🧩 **Frontend freedom:** Each tenant/user can choose to enable/disable features from UI.
- 🔄 **Backend flexibility:** Models support nullable references and toggle flags.
- 🔐 **Role-based access:** Each warehouse, transaction, or report can be permission-controlled.
- 📤 **Pluggable design:** Easily extend inventory to integrate with future modules.

## 📌 Next Steps for Implementation

1. Finalize Item Master schema (include optional fields but default to null).
2. Build warehouse hierarchy (support location bins & multi-company setups).
3. Configure accounting mappings per warehouse/category.
4. Enable integrations per client requirements (Sales, Production, etc.).
5. Develop dashboards and reports with role-based filters.
6. Test full flow: Purchase ➝ GRN ➝ Production ➝ Delivery ➝ Accounting.
7. Make features toggleable from admin panel or client onboarding wizard.
