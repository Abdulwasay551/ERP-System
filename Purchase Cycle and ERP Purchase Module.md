Purchase Cycle and ERP Purchase Module

# **1\. How the Purchase System Cycle Works (Manually or Conceptually)**

The Purchase Cycle (also called Procurement Cycle) refers to the end to end process a company follows to acquire goods or services from suppliers.

## **Step by Step Purchase Cycle:**

1\. Purchase Requisition (PR): Internal department raises a request for needed items.

2\. Purchase Order (PO): Procurement team reviews PR and issues a PO to the selected vendor.

3\. Vendor Confirmation: Supplier accepts PO, confirms pricing and delivery date.

4\. Goods Receipt Note (GRN): Upon delivery, warehouse inspects items and issues a GRN.

5\. Invoice Receipt: Supplier sends an invoice based on the PO and delivery.

6\. Three Way Match: Matching PO, GRN, and Invoice to ensure accuracy before payment.

7\. Payment to Vendor: Accounts department processes payment as per agreed terms.

8\. Purchase Return (if any): If goods are defective or excess, return to vendor is managed.

# **2\. How Purchase Module Works in ERP**

The Purchase Module in ERP automates and tracks all the steps above within a software system.

## **Key Features of ERP Purchase Module:**

• Purchase Requisition (PR): Departments create and submit purchase needs in the system.

• Request for Quotation (RFQ): System sends RFQs to multiple vendors for comparison.

• Vendor Master: Stores complete vendor information (GST, contact, payment terms).

• Purchase Order (PO): Automatically generated from approved PR or RFQ. Can be emailed directly.

• Goods Receipt (GRN): User records received items, which updates inventory and triggers inspection.

• Purchase Invoice: Vendor invoices are entered or uploaded. ERP links them with PO & GRN.

• 3 Way Matching: ERP automatically matches PO, GRN, and Invoice before payment approval.

• Payment Processing: Integrates with Accounts Payable – schedules, tracks, and records payments.

• Reports & Analytics: Gives data on vendor performance, pricing trends, pending POs, etc.

## **How It Connects with Other ERP Modules:**

• Inventory: GRN updates stock automatically.

• Accounts Payable: Invoice and payments get posted in accounting.

• Production / MRP: Autogenerates POs based on material demand planning.

• Budgeting: PR/PO checks against departmental budgets.
