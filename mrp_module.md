# ‚öôÔ∏è MRP (Material Requirements Planning) Module ‚Äì ERP System

This document outlines a complete **MRP Module** for an ERP system. It enables accurate material planning, optimized stock levels, and production alignment based on demand forecasts or actual sales orders.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Overview

MRP automates planning for raw materials and production resources based on:

- Sales Orders
- Forecasts
- Minimum Stock Rules
- Bill of Materials (BoM)

The goal is to ensure materials and products are available at the right time and in the right quantities without overstocking.
