## 🔔 1. Notification System

### 🧭 Objectives

- Alert users about events, tasks, changes, or approvals.
- Enable configurable notifications per module or user group.
- Allow real-time and scheduled alerts (via email, SMS, in-app).

### 📦 Notification Types

| Type             | Description                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Task Reminder    | Notify about pending actions or deadlines        |
| Approval Request | Notify approvers (PO, Leave, Expenses)           |
| System Alert     | Critical alerts (e.g., login, error, audit fail) |
| Expiry/Threshold | Document expiry, stock reorder, license renewal  |
| Announcement     | System-wide or team notices                      |

### 📊 Channels

- In-app (real-time & persistent)
- Email

- Push Notification (mobile/web)

### ⚙️ Configurations

- Notification Templates (custom messages)
- Trigger Points (on model change/status/etc.)

### 🛠️ Sample Trigger Logic (Pseudocode)

```python
if purchase_order.status == "Pending Approval":
    notify(role="Manager", type="Approval Request", link=po_url)
```
