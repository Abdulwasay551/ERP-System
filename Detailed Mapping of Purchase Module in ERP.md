Detailed Mapping of Purchase Module in ERP

# **1\. MASTER DATA SETUP (FOUNDATION)**

Before any transactions, setup is required.

 • Item Master: Contains item code, name, description, UOM, tax rate, purchase price, preferred vendor, lead time, etc.  
 • Supplier Master: Supplier’s name, contact info, bank details, tax number, payment terms, etc.  
 • Warehouse Master: Physical stock locations for delivery and stock transfer.  
 • Chart of Accounts (COA): Expense accounts (e.g., Raw Materials, Consumables, Freight, etc.)  
 • Purchase Taxes & Charges Template: VAT/GST, import duties, freight, custom charges (predefined to auto calculate).

# **2\. TRANSACTIONAL WORKFLOW (STEP BY STEP)**

## **Purchase Requisition (PR)**

Initiated by department/store officer. Triggered by low stock, production need, etc. Can be autogenerated by MRP. May require approval.

## **Request for Quotation (RFQ)**

Optional. Sent to multiple vendors. Compares price, lead time, discount, terms.

## **Supplier Quotation**

Optional. Entered into system for vendor comparison and selection.

## **Purchase Order (PO)**

Created from approved PR or RFQ. Approval required based on value. Sent to vendor.

## **Goods Receipt Note (GRN)**

Warehouse confirms item delivery. Updates inventory. Partial/full receipts allowed.

## **Purchase Invoice**

Linked to PO and GRN. 3way matching enforced (PO \= GRN \= Invoice). Auto updates Accounts Payable.

## **Payment Entry**

Linked to invoice. Records bank or cash payments. Updates GL and vendor account.

## **Purchase Return**

Handles defective/excess items. Updates stock and creates debit note.

# **3\. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER MODULES**

• Inventory: GRN updates stock and valuation.  
 • Accounts: Invoices and payments auto create journal entries.  
 • Production / BOM: Material needs autogenerate PRs.  
 • Fixed Assets: Capital items convert to fixed assets.  
 • Budgeting: PR/PO checked against budgets.  
 • Tax Module: VAT/GST auto applied using tax templates.

# **4\. USER ROLES & APPROVAL WORKFLOW**

• Requisition User: Raises PR.  
 • Purchase Officer: Handles RFQ, quotation, PO.  
 • Warehouse Officer: Handles GRN.  
 • Accounts Department: Books invoices, processes payments.  
 • Approvers: Approve PR, PO, or payments based on limits.

 ERP allows multilevel approvals with notification and logs.
