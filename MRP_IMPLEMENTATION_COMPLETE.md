## üìä Key MRP Workflow

1. **Demand Collection**:
   - Sales orders (actual demand)
   - Demand forecasts (expected demand)
   - Production plans (internal demand)

2. **Supply Analysis**:
   - Current inventory levels
   - Scheduled receipts from work orders
   - Planned purchases and production

3. **MRP Calculation**:
   - Gross requirements calculation
   - Net requirements after considering on-hand inventory
   - BOM explosion for manufactured items
   - Lead time offsetting for order dates

4. **Action Generation**:
   - Purchase requests for buy items
   - Work orders for manufactured items
   - Transfer requests for multi-location scenarios

5. **Execution Tracking**:
   - MRP run logs and audit trails
   - Performance metrics and KPIs
   - Exception reporting and alerts

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Running MRP Manually
```python
# Via API
POST /api/manufacturing/mrp-plans/{id}/calculate/

# Via Management Command
python manage.py run_mrp --company-id 1

# Via UI
Visit /manufacturing/mrp/ and click "Run MRP"
```

### Creating Sample Data
```bash
python manage.py create_mrp_sample_data --company-id 1
```

### Automated MRP Execution
Set up a cron job or scheduled task:
```bash
# Daily MRP run at 6 AM
0 6 * * * /path/to/python manage.py run_mrp
```

### Viewing Reports
- **MRP Dashboard**: `/manufacturing/mrp/`
- **Supply & Demand Report**: `/manufacturing/mrp/supply-demand-report/`

## üìã Configuration Options

### MRP Plan Settings
- Planning horizon (days)
- Include safety stock
- Include reorder points
- Consider lead times
- Auto-create purchase requests

### Reorder Rules
- Reorder method (min-max, reorder point, lot-for-lot)
- Safety stock levels
- Economic order quantities
- Lead time buffers
- Auto-execution flags

## üîß API Usage Examples

### Create and Run MRP Plan
```javascript
// Create MRP Plan
const plan = await fetch('/api/manufacturing/mrp-plans/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        name: 'Weekly MRP Run',
        planning_horizon_days: 90,
        include_safety_stock: true,
        include_reorder_points: true,
        consider_lead_times: true
    })
});

// Run MRP Calculation
const result = await fetch(`/api/manufacturing/mrp-plans/${plan.id}/calculate/`, {
    method: 'POST'
});
```

### Get Supply-Demand Report
```javascript
const report = await fetch(`/api/manufacturing/mrp-plans/${plan.id}/supply_demand_report/`);
const data = await report.json();
```

### Check Reorder Requirements
```javascript
const reorders = await fetch('/api/manufacturing/reorder-rules/check_reorders/', {
