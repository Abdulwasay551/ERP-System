# 🏭 Manufacturing Module – ERP System

This documentation outlines a full-featured **Manufacturing Module** for a scalable and modular ERP system. It includes production planning, BoM management, work orders, operations, costing, traceability, and accounting integration.

---

## ✅ 1. Overview

The Manufacturing module helps companies plan, manage, and control their production processes. It supports make-to-stock, make-to-order, and engineer-to-order models.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Core Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Sales / Production Plan] --> B[Material Requirement Planning (MRP)]
    B --> C[Work Order (WO)]
    C --> D[Operations Execution]
    D --> E[Quality Check (QC)]
    E --> F[FG Receipt to Warehouse]
    F --> G[Costing + Accounting]
```

Each step can be adjusted per business size and complexity.

## 🧱 3. Key Models

### a. **Bill of Materials (BoM)**

- Product
- Version/Revision
- Components (raw materials)
- Work Centers / Operations
- Operation Time (setup, run time)
- Scrap %
- Routing (optional)
- Phantom BoMs (optional)

### b. **Work Order (WO)**

- Linked BoM
- Quantity to manufacture
- Planned start/end
- Assigned operators/machines
- Status: Draft → In Progress → Completed → Cancelled

### c. **Operation Logs**

- Workstation
- Operator
- Start/End timestamps
- Qty produced/rejected
- Downtime reason

### d. **Production Plan (Optional)**

- Based on demand forecast or sales orders
- Plan across multiple WOs
- Capacity constraints

### e. **Job Card / Work Instruction**

- Printed sheet with steps, drawings, safety

## 🧾 4. Accounting Integration

| Action                    | Debit               | Credit                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Raw Material Consumption  | WIP Inventory       | Raw Material Inventory |
| FG Receipt to Warehouse   | Finished Goods Inv. | WIP Inventory          |
| Scrap / Rejected Material | Scrap Expense       | Raw Material Inventory |
| Labor Cost (if tracked)   | WIP Inventory       | Payroll Allocation     |

---

## 📦 5. Inventory Integration

- Raw materials deducted from stock
- FG added to inventory
- Supports batch and serial tracking
- Warehouse per stage (Raw → WIP → FG)

---

## 🧠 6. MRP (Material Requirements Planning)

- Calculate required raw materials
- Plan purchases or inventory transfer
- Based on reorder levels, SOs, forecast
- Optional integration with scheduler

---

## 🧪 7. Quality Checks

- Incoming QC (on raw materials)
- In-process QC
- Final QC (before FG receipt)
- Configurable per BoM / WO
- QC logs with rejection reasons

---

## 📊 8. Reports

- Production Summary Report
- Work Order Status
- Machine Utilization
- Operator Efficiency
- Rejection Rate
- Costing Report (per unit, per batch)

---

## 🔧 9. Configuration Options

- Default warehouse mapping per stage
- Auto-create WO from SO
- Auto-consume raw materials
- Allow backflush costing
- Enable version control on BoM
- UOM conversion
- Batch size limits / min-max

---

## 👥 10. Roles & Permissions

| Role            | Access To                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Production Head | Full access to all              |
| Planner         | Plans, creates WOs              |
| Operator        | Logs operations                 |
| QC Inspector    | Logs QC, accepts/rejects output |
| Store Manager   | Raw issue, FG receipt           |

---

## 🔄 11. Integration with Other Modules

| Module       | Integration Point                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Inventory    | Raw material issue, FG receipt          |
| Sales        | SO triggers WO (Make to Order)          |
| Purchase     | MRP suggests purchases                  |
| Accounting   | Journal entries for material movement   |
| HR/Payroll   | Operator costing (if labor tracked)     |
| Project Mgmt | Manufacturing tasks in project schedule |

---

## 🧩 12. Optional Features

- IoT Integration with machines
- Kanban / Lean Manufacturing Boards
- Barcode scanning per operation
- Engineering Change Orders (ECO)
- Subcontracting / Outsourced manufacturing
- Custom dashboards and KPIs
- Maintenance logs (if integrated with Assets)
